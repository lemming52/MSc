\chapter{\VBFHBB\, Analysis}
\label{c:K}

    After comparing the base constituents of the \VBFHBB\, event between the offline and HLT level and finding them to be similar in behaviour, the specific objects that make up a \VBFHBB\, event can be studied and compared. In this section, the events were required to pass all cuts discussed in Section \ref{es:as} and the designation of the jets as $b_i$, $j_i$ is highlighted in that section. \ref{f:leadingbptvbf}
