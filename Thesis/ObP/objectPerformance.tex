\chapter{Object Performance}\label{c:OP}

Prior to conducting a full study of TLA on the \VBFHBB\, channel, the features of jet objects reconstructed offline and within the HLT were compared to identify any performance differences in the base components of event reconstruction. The jet objects were compared on a one to one basis, by matching an online jet to an offline jet by requiring the $\Delta R$ (Section \ref{t:geometry}) value between the two jets to be below a threshold value of \DELTARTHRESHOLD. This cut was determined from a plot of $\Delta R$ values between all pairs of jets, shown in Figure \ref{f:deltaR}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{deltaR}
	\caption{Plot of $\Delta R$ values for all online/offline jet pairs taken from the Monte-Carlo data. The large spike at $\sim0$ accounts for matching jets, with the higher $\Delta R$ Values corresponding to differing jet pairs.}
	\label{f:deltaR}
\end{figure}
To compare the online and offline jets, the ratio of the difference in value for (significant) jet properties between the matched jets were evaluated. These values were calculated for jet feature $X$ using:

	\begin{equation}
	\frac{\Delta X}{X} = \frac{X_{Offline} - X_{Online}}{X_{Offline}}
	\end{equation}

	where $X_{Offline}$ is the value of the feature on the offline jet, and $X_{Online}$ is from the HLT jet. Specific categories of jets within the event were compared to ensure the most relevant jets for the \VBFHBB\, analysis were comparable.

	The performance of the online and offline jet features was tested bearing in mind the final state products of the \VBFHBB\, interaction, while considering the rapidity of the produced jets. The jets used to produce these plots were taken from all analysed Monte-Carlo events  and all real data events where the trigger was passed, but the additional \VBFHBB\, requirements mentioned in Section \ref{es:as} were not enforced. In addition, given the \pt requirements of the desired event are high, only jets with \pt$>45$GeV were considered for analysis.

\section{Leading \textit{b}-jets}
\label{OP:leadingb}

	The leading \pt offline $b$-jet was selected from an event, requiring the jet to pass the \textit{Tight} \btagging working point. This jet was matched to a corresponding online jet using $\Delta R$ matching, and the properties of each of these jets compared in both Data and Monte-Carlo.

			\label{fig:O:leadingbpt}
		\end{figure}

		\newpage
		The comparative performance of the online and offline jets is \pt is broadly similar for events in both Data and Monte-Carlo. The bulk of the results occur with a \dptpt$\sim0$ and the two plots show a comparable drop off in \pt distribution. The distinctive curve present in the real data is the result of the trigger (Section \ref{es:as}} being applied to each event, which was not applied in the Monte-Carlo data. The real data was required to contain at least one jet with a \pt$>80$GeV which results in the steep drop-off below this cut value.

		The distribution of the \dptpt about 0 can be shown by taking a slice across the distribution for a representative \pt value. The \dptpt values were also split into $\eta$ bands to study performance at different points in the detector. For the leading \bjet, this is constrained to be within the region of the detector where \btagg\, is available.

			\label{fig:O:leadingbptslice}
		\end{figure}

		 The results show similar profiles between the Monte-Carlo and Data events for \dptpt. Both plots show the offline \pt values to be consistently higher than the online, with a median shift of $4\%$ in Data and $2\%$ in Monte-Carlo. The performance between $\eta$ ranges was also consistent. The profiles broadly match the full shape of each other, but the Monte-Carlo showed a slight difference in \dptpt value as the central $\eta$ range peaked at $\sim0$. The breadth of these distributions is quite large, with both Data and Monte-Carlo showing $\pm10\%$ in \dptpt.
		 \newpage
		These comparisons can be carried out for other jet properties ($\eta$, $\phi$) to confirm the offline and online jets are behaving in a similar fashion.

			\label{fig:O:leadingbphi}
		\end{figure}

		The Data and Monte-Carlo distributions for these values are extremely similar to each other, and also show very close agreement between the values for offline and online jet objects. In both cases the median \dxx value is $\sim0$ and the breadth of the distribution is less than $1\%$ of the value.


\newpage
\section{Leading Non \textit{b}-jets}
	\label{OP:leadingnonb}

	For \VBFHBB\, the pair of high \pt forward jets is the other significant feature, so the offline/online performance in the leading non-\bjet was studied.

	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{minipage}[h]{0.48\linewidth}
			\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{ptRatio_Leading_Non_BJet}

		\end{minipage}

		\end{minipage}
		\caption{\dptpt for the leading \pt non $b$-jet against \pt of the offline jet, plotted for Monte-Carlo simulated results (left) and real data (right).}
		\label{fig:O:leadingnonbpt}
	\end{figure}

	The leading non \bjet\, shows a similar situation to the leading \bjet. At the peak of the \dptpt distribution the \pt of the offline jet is within $5\%$ of the online jet, and the overall shape of the distribution is comparable between the Monte-Carlo and real Data events.
	The results could also be split across $\eta$ regions, with the added ability to study the forward regions of the detector.

	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering

		\begin{minipage}[h]{0.48\linewidth}
			\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Slices_ptRatio_Leading_Non_BJet}
		\end{minipage}

		\label{fig:O:leadingnonbptslice}
	\end{figure}

	Both Monte-Carlo and real data show offline jets to be consistently higher \pt than online by $4\%$ and $6\%$ respectively. The overall distribution shape is similar between the simulated and real events for the full set of results, but the distributions for the $\eta$ bands differ between the Monte-Carlo and the real data. The Monte-Carlo results for the central eta band show a dip in \pt at the centre of the distribution and are shifted in \dptpt towards the negative, showing that the online \pt exceeded the offline \pt. In addition, the relative proportions of the three $\eta$ bands differ. The central region of the Monte-Carlo distribution has a flattened peak and peaks at a negative value, showing the offline \pt was less than the online, compared toa positive value for the real data. The Both the MC and the Data show that the offset in \pt value is worse for the jets in the forward region than in the central regions of the detector, with a significantly higher median \dptpt.

	The other topological variables can also be compared.

		\caption{\dphph for the leading non \bjet, for Monte-Carlo events (left) and real data (right)}
		\label{fig:O:leadingnonbphi}
	\end{figure}

	As with the \bjets\, these other variables offline and online jets produce nearly identical results, with the distribution of \dxx firmly centred around 0 and a breadth of less than $1\%$.

	\subsection{Comparison of Jet Objects between Offline and Online}

		The jet objects reconstructed in the HLT have some slight differences in the reported values for key topological variables, but overall they perform in a similar fashion, both in Monte-Carlo simulations and in Real data. The positional variables, $\phi$ and $\eta$ are directly comparable between offline and online jet objects, with the majority of objects having values with $<1\%$ disagreement for both \bjets\, and non \bjets\,. For the \pt of jet objects, the values are not in perfect agreement, but have a consistent offset observed in Monte-Carlo and Real data which could be overcome with specific calibration of the jet objects reconstructed in the HLT.

\section{Jet Tagging Efficiency}

	As covered in Section  \ref{det:btag:mv}, the standard algorithm for 2016 physics analyses was chosen to be the 2016 MV2c10 algorithm. However, the HLT \btag\, algorithm uses the MV2c20 algorithm \cite{trig2015}. In order for any form a Trigger Level Analysis to be considered valid, the performance of the tagging algorithms used in the trigger, which are fixed at the point of data collection, must be comparable with the tagging executed offline with more up to date \btag\, configurations.

	To study this, the \btag\, efficiency at trigger level and offline is studied for different jet flavours using the MC sample. The Monte-Carlo sample was used as being generated rather than recorded the \textit{truth} nature of the jet object was known, and the result of the \btag\, algorithm can be compared to this truth label. This requirement for a truth label means only Monte-Carlo data can be used for this comparison.

	In the analysis, an offline/HLT jet pair was formed using $\Delta R$ matching and truth label of the offline jet used to assign a flavour to the pair. Light-jets, \bjets\, and \cjets\, were all studied separately to view the \btag\, efficiency and the mistag rate of both algorithms operating at the \textit{tight} working point. The efficiency plots in Figures \ref{fig:MC:bjetefficiency}, \ref{fig:MC:cjetefficiency} and \ref{fig:MC:lightjetefficiency} show the fraction of these jets that were identified as \bjets\, by the HLT and offline tagging algorithms.

	\newpage
	\subsection{\textit{b}-jet efficiency}

	For jets labelled as true \bjets, the tagging efficiency can be calculated and plotted with respect to topological variables of the jet objects.

		\end{figure}

	\subsection{\textit{c}-jet efficiency}
	For \cjets\, and light-jets, plotting the same value gives the mistag rate for these jets in the detector.

			\label{fig:MC:lightjetefficiency}
		\end{figure}


	\subsection{Tag Matching}

	For each pair of jets that could be matched between online and offline, and then successfully have a \btag\, decision evaluated on the jets, the agreement of the \btag\, between the two jets was checked. These were found to match one another in $91\%$ of cases.

	\subsection{Comparison of HLT and offline tagging efficiencies}

		Primarily considering the \pt plots of efficiency, the HLT \btag\, is found to be around 5\% less efficient than the offline \btag\, for jets with \pt$>50$GeV. This is a consistent direction of efficiency shift as found when comparing the 2016 MV2c10 and 2015 MV2c20 algorithms on the training $t\bar{t}$ sample, but of a larger magnitude. The increase in the rate of \cjet\, mistagging is absolutely consistent with the refinements to the algorithm between the 2016 MV2c10 and 2015 MV2c20, with increased levels of \cjet\, rejection in the offline 2016 MV2c10, and the $\sim40$\% increase is consistent with the expected shift from the optimised algorithm \cite{btagOptimisation}.
