THEORETICAL BACKGROUND (ORDER ISSUES):

    Collisions
    Jets
    B Jets

        Topology
        Backgrounds
        Channels



ONLINE/OFFLINE COMPARISON (DIRECT):

    Jet multiplicity?

    Kinematics:
            General kinematic vars for all comparable jets, ratios

            For: pt, eta, m, phi:
                paired general distribution and also specific ratio (would need to add an eta plot)
                (4x hist/ratio plots + 4x 2d plots)
                alternative: for general dist, show data + mc on same chart (normalising issues) with separate 2dratio plots

                i.e. 16 or 12 plots

        B Jets/ Non B Jets:
            For Each:
            choice, either plotting of all or just leading, same plots as available for general kinematic vars
            could use either truth or tagged for MC

                i.e 32 / 24 plots, these could hypothetically be combined with above

        Forward Jets:
            This is where eta splitting would be most relevant

    B Tagging:
            algorithm input vars (requires working on AOD, or just showing online ones)

            Efficiency plots, c, tau, light, pt, eta, m,

            Matching value

ONLINE/OFFLINE COMPARISON (HbbVBF):

    Naked VBF plots

    2C:
        Signature Kinematics
            mbb, mjj, data/mc plots, blinded
        Cut Flows
            Reasons for differences
        S/B

    4C (hopefully):
        same

FURTHER:

    Comparison of MC/Data
    Evaluation of possible S/B improvements
        background + signal count hists
    Evaluation of possible cut changes
        cutflwo count changes between different kinematic cuts
    Need for (CPU) rate considerations
