THEORETICAL BACKGROUND (ORDER ISSUES):

    Collisions
    Jets
    B Jets

ONLINE/OFFLINE COMPARISON (DIRECT):

    Kinematics:
            General kinematic vars for all comparable jets, ratios
        B Jets?
        J Jets?
        Event Topologies/ Signatures/ Makeup
            trigger emulation counts?
        Forward Jets:
            kinematic vars

    B Tagging:
            plot: algorithm input vars
            kinematics of tagged b jets
        Efficiencies
            already made effciiency plots

ONLINE/OFFLINE COMPARISON (HbbVBF):

    Naked VBF plots

    2C:
        Signature Kinematics
            mbb, mjj, data/mc plots, blinded
        Cut Flows
            Reasons for differences
        S/B

    4C (hopefully):
        same

FURTHER:

    Comparison of MC/Data
    Evaluation of possible S/B improvements
        background + signal count hists
    Evaluation of possible cut changes
        cutflwo count changes between different kinematic cuts
    Need for (CPU) rate considerations
